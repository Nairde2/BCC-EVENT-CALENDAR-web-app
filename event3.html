We are thrilled to bring you the video highlights of the BEED Day 2024 Literary Events, held at the BCC Library today September 27, 2024—a hub of creativity where our talented BEED students showcased their best works in the Poster Making, Slogan Crafting, and Essay Writing competitions. The participants demonstrated their unique perspectives on the power of education and their pride in being part of the BEED community.

These events not only displayed the artistic and intellectual abilities of our students but also underscored the values that define our department—passion, inclusivity, and excellence. Each work of art, each slogan, and every essay tells a story of dedication, commitment, and the heart of education that lies at the core of every BEED student.

We extend our deepest thanks to our judges for their time, expertise, and dedication in selecting the winners from an array of outstanding submissions. Their guidance has helped us celebrate the finest talents that the BEED department has to offer.

The much-awaited Official Announcement of Winners will take place during the grand BEED Day 2024 Celebration on October 04, 2024! Mark your calendars and stay tuned to find out which creative minds will be recognized for their exceptional work.

Thank you to all participants for your hard work and enthusiasm—your contributions have truly made BEED Day 2024 a memorable and inspiring event. No matter the results, each of you has already won by sharing your voice, your heart, and your vision with us.</p>
